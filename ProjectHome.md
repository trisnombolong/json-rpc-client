Use same protocol (JSON) for communicating with Web Services from both browser and native clients.

The excellent JSON-RPC project (http://oss.metaparadigm.com/jsonrpc) provides a server part, a JavaScript client and most of the infrastructure.

This project provides a Java client part if you need to call JSON-RPC from Java application.
